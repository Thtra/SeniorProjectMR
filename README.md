# SeniorProjectMR

 This is my senior capstone project. The system will allow users to interact with interactive holograms while they are in video conferencing 
 applications such as Zoom and Skype using mixed reality.
 Users can import a model from Google Poly into Unity during runtime. They can send in their webcam video into Unity and then 
 after processing they can send that as webcam video into a video-conferencing application such as Zoom or Skype. 
 With the use of the Oculus Quest 2, it can act as a mixed reality interface, tracking system, and virtual object manipulation system.
